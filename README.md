## I'm a python developer, though I also can use HTML, JS, CSS for making basic websites and C for small applications.
Some of my bigger projects:
### [KiesJeRijksDocent](https://github.com/Jelte2357/kiesjerijksdocent)
- A website for my exam prank (a tradition in the netherlands), on which you could vote for your favourite teacher of the year.
### [Jetlag the game Discord bot](https://github.com/Jelte2357/JetLag-The-Game-Tag-Discord-Bot)
- A discord bot that allows the user to play the game tag across europe from the series jetlag on youtube.
### [Concentrator](https://github.com/Jelte2357/Concentrator)
- My final project for CS50X. This python program uses a gui and the closing of apps for you to make sure you concentrate on your work.
### [AutoReqs](https://github.com/Jelte2357/AutoRequirements)
- Pipreqs didn't always work for me, so I set out on the challenge to make a requirements.txt file using only standard libraries.
