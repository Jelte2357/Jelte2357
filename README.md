- I’m currently working on a discord bot and more programs for a radio studio at my school
- Yet to do:
- [x] Comments in the discord bot
- [x] Comments in the audiosender

- [ ] Get the ethernet port at the radio studio switched to the same one as on the dependance
      
- [ ] Fixing the main program:
- [ ] For work with multithreading
- [ ] For work with pc + raspberry pi
- [ ] Comments

- [x] Testing audio in the dependance

- Other projects:
- Making a discord bot to play a version of Jet Lag The Game (tag across -place-)
- On that project i still have a lot to do, but ill enjoy playtesting!
